## Project Overview

This project utilizes the Databricks platform to build an ETL pipeline simulating a real-time business scenario. We are assuming a company called Atlicon already has an established ETL pipeline. Now, Atlicon wants to merge a new child company named SportsBar into its operations.

For this purpose, we’ve created an ETL pipeline specifically for the SportsBar company. This pipeline processes several tables: the Customers table, Products table, Price table, and Orders table. After transforming and preparing these tables, the data is merged into the existing gold-level table of Atlicon. This enables combined and aggregated analytics in the future.
